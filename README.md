# Simple AI Project: **"Minimalist Genius"**

This repository showcases a simple AI that runs on low-end hardware and offers basic functionalities like grammar correction, answering questions, online searches, teaching and testing the AI, and reporting bugs. The AI is designed for minimal resource usage, making it accessible on even the slowest systems.

## **Features**
1. **Grammar Correction**  
   Provide a sentence, and the AI will correct grammatical errors efficiently.
   
2. **Question Answering**  
   Ask the AI factual or conceptual questions and receive clear, concise answers.

3. **Online Searching**  
   The AI performs online searches and retrieves summarized results.

4. **Teach the AI**  
   Extend the AI's knowledge by teaching it new facts or skills.

5. **Exam the AI**  
   Test the AI on what it's learned to evaluate its retained knowledge.

6. **Bug Reporting**  
   Report bugs directly through the interface, logging the issues for review.

## **System Requirements**
- **RAM**: 4 GB  
- **Storage**: Slow HDD compatible  
- **CPU**: Basic, no GPU required  
- **OS**: Linux/Windows/Mac
